# Reflection: Static Code Analysis Lab

1. **Easiest and most challenging issues:**
   - The simplest issues to correct were mainly stylistic â€” for example, missing docstrings, inconsistent naming, and line length violations detected by Flake8.
   - The more complex fixes involved improving exception handling and replacing general `except:` statements with specific exceptions to make the program safer and more reliable.

2. **False positives:**
   - No significant false positives were encountered. The warnings generated by Pylint and Flake8 were accurate and mainly focused on formatting and naming practices.

3. **Integrating static analysis into development:**
   - Tools such as **Pylint**, **Flake8**, and **Bandit** can be added to the development pipeline through **GitHub Actions** or **pre-commit hooks**.
   - Doing so helps ensure that every code submission is automatically checked for quality, style, and security before merging.

4. **Observed improvements:**
   - After applying the fixes, the code became more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.
   - Enhanced error handling and input validation made the program more stable.
   - The final Bandit scan showed no security flaws, and the overall Pylint score reflected a clear improvement in code quality.
